# WhizzML for SublimeText

For now only syntax higlighting and autocompletions, more to come.
Tested only in SublimeText 3, probably won't work in previous versions.

## Instalattion

Copy `WhizzML.sublime-syntax` and `WhizzML.sublime-completions into
`<path-to-sublime-installation>/Packages/User`
and, if wanted, copy also `WhizzML.sublime-settings` in the same location
to define settings for a better code writting. (This will be automated)
when this is distributed as an "official" SublimeText package.
