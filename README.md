# WhizzML for SublimeText

For now only syntax higlighting, more to come.
Tested only in SublimeText 3, probably won't work in previous versions.

## Instalattion

Copy `WhizzML.sublime-syntax` into
`<path-to-sublime-installation>/Packages/User`
and, if wanted, define your WhizzML preferences as defined in
`WhizzML.sublime-settings` for a better code writting. (This will be automated)
when this is distributed as an "official" SublimeText package.
